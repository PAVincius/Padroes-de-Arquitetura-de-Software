Here is an example of a CQRS architecture in JavaScript, using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js):

**MongoDB**: This will be used as the database to store and retrieve data.

**Express**: This will be used as the back-end framework to handle the routing and communication with the MongoDB database.

**React**: This will be used as the front-end library to create the user interface and handle the interactions with the back-end.

**Node.js**: This will be used to run the back-end server and handle the communication between the front-end and back-end.

The code in this repo is for an approach for a CQRS architecture in JavaScript using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It includes classes for Paciente, MedicalRecord, EquipeSaude, UnityService and it's communication with the backend.

It's important to mention that this code is only a **template** and it would require further development and adjustments to be fully functional, like including the routes, services and controllers, and functionalities to the frontend.
